# swift-coding-challenge
This repository contains the code samples for this question posted at this repo: https://github.com/swift-nav/screening_questions/blob/master/questions.md#swift-navigation-application-questions

I have included Python and C samples in my submission. I implemented a non-recursive algorithm to generate F(n)

The python sample includes a simple test that tests fibonacci number generation - (Written for python3.x)

Execution: python3 fibonacci.py N <br />
e.g.: python3 fibonacci.py 23 <br />

I have also included a C program that can be compiled using the make file.<br />

Clone the repository and run make.<br />
make <br />
./fibonacci 23 <br />
